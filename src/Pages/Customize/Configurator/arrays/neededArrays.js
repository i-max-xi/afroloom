        "Money has wings is the translation for this fabric. Money indeed flies where it wants to go. If it is not handled well, it will be lost. Bad or wrong investment decisions will cause one to lose money. Birds are a group of feathered theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only living dinosaurs.Likewise, birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive. The ability to fly is one of the most unique features of birds. The motif is a profile of a bird in an oval shape repeated systematically to give a feeling of movement. It is also made of some horizontal lines repeated throughout the design and serves as fabric textures.",

      textureName: "Nsubra",
      textureDescription:
        "“Nsubura” is an Akan word or “nubu” (Ga) which literally means deep well of water. Water extracted from deep down the earth or underground is clean or has been purified by nature. Before one gets this clean or purified water, it needs hard work, since the person has to dig deep to get the water. The main motif of the fabric is designed with an oval shape and a moon-like shaded blue to form a complete circle, in a purple circular shape. The purple circular shape is surrounded by multiple oval shapes arranged in a circular form from the smallest to the biggest on a yellowish green background. The motif is arranged using the full-drop pattern repeat on a purple background with shaded blue spots connected with each other with the aid of short lines. The design gives the impression of radial balance. This fabric is the trending fabric in Ghana now and worldwide and can be found sewn into a dress, shirt, and shorts, among others. Its varying colours and bold print renders it versatile and confident.",

      textureName: "Ahwene pa nkasa",
      textureDescription:
        "Ahwenepa nkasa, can be interpreted to mean “Ahwenepa” (Good waist beads) “nkasa” (makes no noise). Thus, a “good waist beads do not make noise”. This is a common proverb among Ghanaians which implies you should let your deeds or character speak for you, in other words, do not be arrogant; let your achievements speak for themselves. This can be related to mean a good man or a good woman needs no introduction to be known. Someone can notice them through simple interaction. A good man or woman is hard to find but when you meet that special person, you will easily notice. “Ahwene pa nkasa” is designed with a floral pattern arranged using all-round techniques. The elements employed in the design include floral design, lines (curvy, diagonal and spiral lines), dots, shapes and colours. The design has the wax printing method for the background and the block printing technique for the floral pattern. The elements in the design are harmonious as a result of the use of cool colours and the white spots on the background as well as white lines, shapes and dots used in the floral design.",

Highlife is a blend of traditional Akan rhythms and melodies with European musical elements, such asthe use of European instruments and harmony. The elements employed in the design include lines (vertical and horizontal lines), shapes and colours. The interplay of lines creating variety of shapes such as triangles, rectangles, rhombuses, among others is balanced with the dots and vein-like effects created in the background. The principle of harmony is employed in the creation of the background of the cloth with random curvy lines and colours that harmonise with each other. The highlife cloth comes in different colours",

      textureDescription:
        "‘Efie mmosea’ means gravels in the home/house. The design depicts gravels found in the compound of Ghanaian traditional homes. It resembles small stones that are arranged systematically to give a sense of movement. It is believed that a person from one’s family can be wicked or can harm one more than an outsider. This is because a family member knows everything about the person and can easily destroy the person based on the details he/she has. The popular adage is, “fie mbosabo sɛ ɔtwa wua, ɔyɛ yaw” literally when a member of your family hurts you, it is very painful. Among the Ewes and Gas ethnic groups, it means the poor man does not chew stones. No one chews stones as food when hungry in the Ghanaian community. We are one another’s keepers, therefore when your neighbour is in trouble, the members of the society deem it a duty to help. Members of society help one another for unity",
